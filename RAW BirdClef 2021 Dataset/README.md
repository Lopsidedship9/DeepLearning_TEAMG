# DeepLearning_TEAMG - RAW Data to test Prepare Jupyter code
This sample RAW data is extracted from:
- **BirdCLEF 2021 Mel Spectrograms Dataset** on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/defined/birdclef-2021-mel-spectograms ).
- **BirdCLEF 2021 - Birdcall Identification** on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/birdclef-2021/).

It has been prepared to allow you **test and run** the **"Prepare" Jupyter notebooks** included in this repository .

Please note that this is not the complete datasetâ€”it only includes a small subset of selected classes. This reduction is intentional in order to minimize the repository size and make it easier to test the workflow without requiring the full dataset.
