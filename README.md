To reproduce our results, you need to download the sample data provided in the repository at the Sample Dataset folder.
Once downloaded, you will have access to a sample dataset of Mel-spectrograms and a .csv file containing information about each Mel-spectrogram.
These are the same samples we used. If you want to try something new, please refer to the Prepare New Data folder.

To start running the experiments, you can use the notebooks in the Notebooks folder.
If you want to test different optimizers, start with the Test_Optim_for_MobileNetV2.ipynb notebook. Make sure to update the file paths so the notebook can locate the downloaded dataset.
If you want to test different models, use the Test_Models_Training_CNN.ipynb notebook, and again, be sure to change the paths accordingly.
